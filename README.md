# PHP Programming Language

## PHP Overview

PHP is a server-side scripting language primarily designed for use on web servers, although it can also serve as a general-purpose programming language. Created in the 1990s by Rasmus Lerdorf, PHP is fully object-oriented.

The most common application of PHP is in web development. It can be seamlessly integrated with HTML and other web technologies, making it a staple in the web development landscape.

PHP originated as a set of simple C programs to help its founder maintain his website's homepage but evolved into a fully-fledged programming language by 1997.

## How PHP is Run

PHP code is typically executed using an interpreter that resides on the web server. Once the PHP code is executed, a finished webpage is sent to the user. This process allows for the creation of dynamic web pages, where aspects of the website can change based on the execution results of the PHP code.

The most popular PHP interpreter is completely free and can be deployed on most web servers and operating systems. Its cost-effectiveness and portability have contributed to PHP's prominence in the web development world.

PHP features a garbage collector, and its syntax is based on C and C++.

## Choosing an IDE

Many developers prefer to write PHP using basic text editors, as PHP is often written in the same environment as the HTML and front-end technologies it interacts with. However, several specialized IDEs have been developed, with popular choices including Visual Studio Code Editor, NetBeans, PHPStorm, and Adobe Dreamweaver.

- **Visual Studio Code Editor**: A free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It supports PHP development through various extensions that enhance the coding experience. Some popular free PHP extensions include:
  - **PHP Intelephense**: Provides features like code completion, signature help, and diagnostics.
  - **PHP Debug**: Enables debugging of PHP scripts using Xdebug.
  - **PHP DocBlocker**: Helps in generating PHPDoc blocks for your code.
  - **PHP Namespace Resolver**: Automatically adds and removes PHP namespaces use statements.
  - **PHP CS Fixer**: A tool to automatically fix PHP coding standards issues.
- **NetBeans**: An open-source IDE that supports multiple languages, including PHP. It offers features like code templates, debugging, and version control integration.
- **PHPStorm**: A commercial IDE specifically designed for PHP development. It provides advanced coding assistance, on-the-fly error prevention, and automated refactorings.
- **Adobe Dreamweaver**: A web development tool that combines a visual design surface and a code editor with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and integration with other Adobe products.

## XAMPP Server

XAMPP is the title used for a compilation of free software. The name is an acronym, with each letter representing one of the five key components. The software packet contains the web server Apache, the relational database management system MySQL (or MariaDB), and the scripting languages Perl and PHP. The initial X stands for the operating systems that it works with: Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.

- **Apache**: The open-source web server Apache is the most widely used server worldwide for the delivery of web content. The server application is made available as free software by the Apache Software Foundation.
- **MySQL/MariaDB**: In MySQL, XAMPP contains one of the most popular relational database management systems in the world. In combination with the web server Apache and the scripting language PHP, MySQL offers data storage for web services. Current XAMPP versions have replaced MySQL with MariaDB (a community-developed fork of the MySQL project, made by the original developers).
- **PHP**: The server-side programming language PHP enables users to create dynamic websites or applications. PHP can be installed on all platforms and supports a number of diverse database systems.
- **Perl**: The scripting language Perl is used in system administration, web development, and network programming. Like PHP, Perl also enables users to program dynamic web applications.

Alongside these core components, this free-to-use Apache distribution contains some other useful tools, which vary depending on your operating system. These tools include the mail server Mercury, the database administration tool phpMyAdmin, the web analytics software solutions Webalizer, OpenSSL, and Apache Tomcat, and the FTP servers FileZilla or ProFTPd.

### Application areas

An XAMPP server can be installed and used with a single executable file quickly and easily, functioning as a local test system for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. The software packet contains the same components that are found on common web servers. Developers have the chance to test out their projects locally and to transfer them easily to productive systems. But XAMPP isnâ€™t suitable to use as a public server, because many safety features have been deliberately left out to simplify and speed up the system for testing.

### Installing XAMPP

1. Download XAMPP ([https://www.apachefriends.org/de/download.html]).
2. In this tutorial, I install XAMPP on Windows 11 (Run .exe file).
3. Path to the XAMPP environment path to D:\xampp and PHP to D:\xampp\php
4. Show the instruction on how to xampp installation, click on this link [https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/tools/xampp-tutorial-create-your-own-local-test-server/]

### Compiling and Running PHP Programs on Windows

#### Prerequisites

Before you can compile and run PHP programs on Windows, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- XAMPP installed on your system.
- A text editor or an IDE for writing PHP code.
- Basic knowledge of PHP syntax and programming concepts.

#### Steps to Compile and Run

1. Open your text editor or IDE and write your PHP code.
2. Save the PHP file in the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation (e.g., `D:\xampp\htdocs\`).
3. Start the Apache server using the XAMPP control panel.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/yourfile.php` to run your PHP program.

Alternatively, you can use the following methods to run your PHP project:

- **Run PHP Script Directly**:
  ```powershell
  PS D:\xampp\htdocs\webdev\Php_Basics> php printing/hello.php
  <h1>Hello World</h1><hr/><p>This is a PHP tutorial</p>
  ```

- **Using XAMPP Server**:

  ```powershell
  Start the XAMPP server and navigate to:
  http://localhost/webdev/Php_Basics/printing/hello.php
  ```

- **Using PHP Built-in Development Server**:

  ```powershell
  PS D:\xampp\htdocs\webdev\Php_Basics> php -S localhost:8000
  [Fri Jan 10 09:50:12 2025] PHP 8.3.12 Development Server (http://localhost:8000) started
  ```

  Then open your web browser and navigate to:
  <http://localhost:8000/printing/hello.php>

```

### Debugging and Project Management

#### Debugging PHP Code

To debug PHP code, you can use tools like Xdebug, which is a PHP extension that provides debugging and profiling capabilities. You can integrate Xdebug with your IDE to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your code.

#### Adding the Project to GitHub

To add your PHP project to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Initialize a Git repository in your project directory using `git init`.
2. Add your project files to the repository using `git add .`.
3. Commit the changes using `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.
4. Create a new repository on GitHub and copy the repository URL.
5. Add the remote repository using `git remote add origin <repository-url>`.
6. Push the changes to GitHub using `git push -u origin master`.

#### Update the Existing Remote

To update the existing remote repository, use the following commands:

1. Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository using `git fetch`.
2. Merge the changes into your local branch using `git merge origin/master`.
3. Push the updated changes to the remote repository using `git push`.

#### Remove the Existing Remote and Add Again

If you need to remove the existing remote repository and add it again, use the following commands:

1. Remove the existing remote using `git remote remove origin`.
2. Add the new remote repository using `git remote add origin <new-repository-url>`.
3. Push the changes to the new remote repository using `git push -u origin master`.
